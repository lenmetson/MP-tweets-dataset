    "In this file, I will run through how to obtain data from WikiData's API. I am using a Jypyter notebook because I think I will need to use python, or a mix of python and R. There used to be an SPARQL complier package in R which we could have used to write the request (then possibly combined with `httr` to dynamically pull the WikiData) but I could not get it to work with the latest version of R. \n",
